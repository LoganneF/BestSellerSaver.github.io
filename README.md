The concept:
A place to find current top five NYT best sellers and store them as a "wish list"

The layout:
Landing page with introduction of NYT best sellers that leads user to their "shelf"

Main page has a generate button at the top that fills 5 cards, each with brief info on the current top five best sellers.

There are two columns. Left column holds current book info, right column is user's bookshelf. User can drag cards to right column to store them on the shelf


The API:
The app accesses the New York Times' Books API from their site:
https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/routes/lists/overview.json/get
